<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steering Torque Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steering torque sensors are devices used in vehicles to measure the force applied to the steering system. Contact type sensors rely on physical contact with the steering column to measure the torque. They have direct interaction with the steering mechanism, making them accurate but prone to wear and tear. Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, use magnetic or optical technologies to measure torque without physical contact. They offer advantages like durability and higher reliability but may be less accurate compared to contact type sensors.</p></p>
