<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smoke Extraction Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Axial Type</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The smoke extraction fan market comprises three main types: centrifugal type, axial type, and others. Centrifugal type fans work by accelerating the air radially and then redirecting it tangentially, resulting in higher pressure and lower flow. Axial type fans, on the other hand, move air in a parallel direction to the fan axis, generating high airflow at low pressures. Lastly, the "others" category includes fans with unique designs or combinations of centrifugal and axial characteristics. These different fan types cater to diverse smoke extraction needs in various industries and applications.</p></p>
