<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Tendons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vitro Tissue</li><li>Internal Tissue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial tendons are a type of medical implant used to replace or repair damaged tendons. In Vitro Tissue Market, artificial tendons are created outside the body using tissue engineering techniques, where cells and biomaterials are combined to construct the implant. These tendons are then implanted into the patient's body. On the other hand, in the Internal Tissue Market, artificial tendons are created using synthetic materials such as polymers, which are directly implanted into the patient's body to replace or repair damaged tendons. Both types aim to provide a durable and functional solution for tendon injuries.</p></p>
