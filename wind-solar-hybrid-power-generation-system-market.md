<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind-solar Hybrid Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System</li><li>Stand-Alone System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind-solar hybrid power generation systems can be classified into two types: on-grid system and stand-alone system. </p><p>The on-grid system connects the power generated by the wind and solar sources to the main electrical grid. This allows excess power to be fed back into the grid, enabling users to earn credits or receive payment for the electricity they generate. </p><p>In contrast, a stand-alone system operates independently and is not connected to the grid. It relies solely on the wind and solar sources to generate and store electricity for local consumption, making it suitable for remote areas or locations without access to a reliable electricity grid.</p></p>
