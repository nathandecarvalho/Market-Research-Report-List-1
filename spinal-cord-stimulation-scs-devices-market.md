<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable SCS</li><li>Non-Rechargeable SCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) Devices Market comprises two main types of devices: Rechargeable SCS and Non-Rechargeable SCS. Rechargeable SCS devices are designed to be replenished with power, allowing them to be used for extended periods without replacement. This type of device provides flexibility and convenience to patients. On the other hand, Non-Rechargeable SCS devices lack the capacity for recharging and need to be replaced when the battery runs out. Although they require device replacement surgeries, they are generally less expensive than rechargeable options. Both types offer pain relief by delivering electrical currents to the spinal cord.</p></p>
