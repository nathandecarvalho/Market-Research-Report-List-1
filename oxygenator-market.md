<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygenator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>General Oxygenator</li><li>ECMO Oxygenator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oxygenator market comprises two main types: general oxygenators and ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) oxygenators. General oxygenators are devices used during cardiac surgeries or procedures to oxygenate blood outside the body. They work by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen before returning the blood to the patient. On the other hand, ECMO oxygenators are specifically designed for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a life support technique used for patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. These oxygenators provide prolonged oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide, supporting the patient's organs and allowing time for recovery.</p></p>
