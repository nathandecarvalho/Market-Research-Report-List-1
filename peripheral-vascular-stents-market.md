<p><h1>Peripheral Vascular Stents Market Size, and Examines its Market Scope, with a Primary Focus on Growth Opportunities, and Forecasted Trends Spanning from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Peripheral Vascular Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Peripheral vascular stents are devices used to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is caused by the build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the legs and arms. These stents are cylindrical metal mesh tubes that are placed in the narrowed or blocked arteries to help improve blood flow and prevent further blockages.</p><p>The global peripheral vascular stents market has been witnessing steady growth due to the increasing prevalence of PAD, along with the rising geriatric population and the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures. Technological advancements in stent designs, such as drug-eluting stents that release medication to prevent reblockage, are further driving market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the market is benefiting from the rising awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of PAD, as well as the increasing demand for outpatient procedures that offer quick recovery and reduced hospital stays. Additionally, the development of bioresorbable stents that gradually dissolve over time is expected to fuel market growth in the coming years.</p><p>The market for peripheral vascular stents is also witnessing certain trends. For instance, there is a shift towards the use of self-expanding stents as they offer better flexibility and adaptability to vessel anatomy. Market players are focusing on developing stents with improved durability, anti-restenotic properties, and reduced risk of complications. Furthermore, collaborations and partnerships between stent manufacturers and healthcare providers are becoming more common, leading to improved market penetration.</p><p>In conclusion, the peripheral vascular stents market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of PAD, technological advancements, and rising awareness about early diagnosis and treatment contribute to the market's growth.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-expandable</li><li>Self-expandable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral vascular stents are medical devices used to treat blockages or narrowings in the blood vessels outside the heart and brain. There are two main types on the market: balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents. Balloon-expandable stents are made of metal mesh and are inserted into the blood vessel using a balloon catheter. They are expanded by inflating the balloon, providing support to keep the artery open. Self-expandable stents are made of materials that have intrinsic radial force. They open on their own once deployed in the artery, without the need for a balloon catheter.</p></p>
