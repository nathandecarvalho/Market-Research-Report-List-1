<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Power Supply Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC/DC Power Supply</li><li>DC/DC Power Supply</li><li>Internal Backup Batteries</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ventilator power supply market consists of three types: AC/DC power supply, DC/DC power supply, and internal backup batteries. AC/DC power supplies convert the alternating current (AC) from the electrical grid to direct current (DC) required by the ventilator. DC/DC power supplies further convert the DC power to the required voltage level for specific components. Internal backup batteries serve as a secondary power source during power outages or when the primary power source fails, ensuring uninterrupted operation. These power supply types are crucial for the efficient and reliable functioning of ventilators.</p></p>
