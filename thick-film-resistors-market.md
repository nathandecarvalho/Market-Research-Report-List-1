<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Film Resistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD Type</li><li>Through Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick film resistors are electronic components used to control the flow of electric current in circuits. They can be divided into two main types: SMD (Surface Mount Device) and Through Hole. SMD resistors are smaller in size and are directly mounted on the circuit board's surface using soldering techniques. Through Hole resistors, on the other hand, have leads that go through holes in the circuit board and are soldered on the opposite side. The choice of resistor type depends on factors like circuit design, space availability, and manufacturing requirements.</p></p>
