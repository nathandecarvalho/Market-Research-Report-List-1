<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Equipment Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-based Cooling</li><li>Air-based Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical equipment cooling market consists of two primary types: liquid-based cooling and air-based cooling. In liquid-based cooling, a cooling fluid, typically water, is used to transfer heat away from the medical equipment. This method is effective for high-power devices that generate significant heat. On the other hand, air-based cooling involves the use of fans or blowers to circulate air around the medical equipment, dissipating heat. This method is generally used for low to medium power devices where liquid cooling may not be necessary.</p></p>
