<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Cryogenic Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen cryogenic pumps are classified into two main types - centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps work by using a rotating impeller to create a low-pressure area to draw in and move the nitrogen fluid. On the other hand, positive displacement pumps use chambers of fixed volume to displace the fluid, providing a more constant and consistent flow rate. Each type of pump has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications within the nitrogen cryogenic market.</p></p>
