<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Fire Alarm Systems</li><li>Addressable Fire Alarm Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Conventional Fire Alarm Systems are widely used and cost-effective in small to medium-sized buildings. They divide the building into zones, and when a device in a zone detects a fire or smoke, a general alarm is activated. Addressable Fire Alarm Systems are more advanced and suitable for larger, complex buildings. Each device (fire detector, heat detector, etc.) has a unique address, allowing the control panel to pinpoint the exact location of the fire. This system offers detailed information, easy expansion, and advanced programming capabilities but is typically more expensive.</p></p>
