<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sealless Magnetic Drive Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sealless magnetic drive pumps are classified into two market types: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In stationary shaft pumps, the shaft does not rotate, and the impeller is magnetically driven without any mechanical seal. This design ensures zero leakage of fluids, making it ideal for handling hazardous or corrosive substances. On the other hand, rotating shaft pumps have a rotating magnet within the impeller, which is driven by the motor shaft. These pumps offer higher efficiency and can handle higher pressures, but require a mechanical seal to prevent leakage.</p></p>
