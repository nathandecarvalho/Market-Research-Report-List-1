<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor Compression Distiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Vapor Compression Distiller</li><li>Thermocompression Distiller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapor Compression Distiller (VCD) is a technology used for water desalination or purification. There are two main types of VCD systems: Mechanical Vapor Compression Distiller (MVCD) and Thermocompression Distiller (TCD). </p><p>MVCD utilizes a mechanical compressor to increase the pressure and temperature of the vapor, promoting distillation. In contrast, TCD employs a more energy-efficient technique by using steam from an external source to heat the vapor, eliminating the need for a mechanical compressor. Both types are effective in producing clean water by separating impurities from the vapor.</p></p>
