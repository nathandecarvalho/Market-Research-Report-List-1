<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Racing Bike Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clincher Bike Tyres</li><li>Tubular Bike Tyres</li><li>Tubeless Bike Tyres</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The racing bike tyres market consists of three main types: clincher, tubular, and tubeless bike tyres. Clincher bike tyres are the most common type and feature an outer tyre that clinches onto the rim with inner tubes holding the air. Tubular bike tyres have a tube sewn inside the tyre and are traditionally glued onto special rims. Tubeless bike tyres, on the other hand, do not require inner tubes and are sealed to the rim to maintain air pressure. Each type offers different benefits and performance characteristics for racing and cycling enthusiasts.</p></p>
