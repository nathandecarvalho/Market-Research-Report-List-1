<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indirect Water Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Coiled Type</li><li>External Submerged Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Indirect water heaters come in two main types: internal coiled type and external submerged type. Internal coiled type indirect water heaters have a coiled heat exchanger immersed inside the storage tank, which transfers heat from a boiler to the water. On the other hand, external submerged type indirect water heaters have a separate storage tank and a submerged heat exchanger, allowing the boiler water to pass through the exchanger and heat the water indirectly. Both types offer efficient and effective ways to heat water using a separate heating source.</p></p>
