<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Power Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-grid PV Power Station</li><li>Off-grid PV Power Station</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PV power stations, also known as solar power plants, can be divided into two main market types: on-grid and off-grid. On-grid PV power stations are connected to the electric grid and supply electricity directly into the grid for public consumption. These power stations usually require permits and follow regulations imposed by the grid operator. On the other hand, off-grid PV power stations are independent systems that generate electricity for self-consumption or for remote areas without access to the grid. These systems typically rely on battery storage to store excess energy for later use.</p></p>
