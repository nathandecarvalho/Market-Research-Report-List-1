<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Soft Starts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Couplings</li><li>Flexidyne Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical soft starts are devices used in motor systems to gradually increase the speed of a motor, reducing the sudden torque and stress on the mechanical components. Fluid couplings are a type of mechanical soft start that uses hydraulic fluid to transmit torque from the motor to the driven load, effectively reducing shock and vibrations during start-up. On the other hand, Flexidyne couplings are another type of mechanical soft start that use a combination of flywheel and torsional damper to absorb and dissipate the initial torque, ensuring a smooth and controlled start-up.</p></p>
