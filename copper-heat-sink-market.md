<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Heat Sink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Heat Sink</li><li>Active Heat Sink</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The copper heat sink market comprises two main types: passive heat sinks and active heat sinks. Passive heat sinks are designed to dissipate heat by using airflow caused by natural convection or forced convection without any additional power source. They are simple and cost-effective solutions for cooling purposes. On the other hand, active heat sinks rely on fans or pumps to create additional airflow, enhancing heat dissipation. These heat sinks are suitable for high-power applications where passive cooling alone may not be sufficient to maintain optimal temperature levels.</p></p>
