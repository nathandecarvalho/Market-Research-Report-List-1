<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HER-2 Targeted Drugs for Breast Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trastuzumab</li><li>Pertuzumab</li><li>Lapatinib</li><li>Neratinib</li><li>Trastuzumab Emtansine</li><li>Pyrotinib</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HER-2 targeted drugs are used in the treatment of breast cancer specifically when the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) is overexpressed. Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, Lapatinib, Neratinib, Trastuzumab Emtansine, Pyrotinib, and other similar drugs make up this market. Trastuzumab works by binding to HER-2 receptors, inhibiting cancer cell growth. Pertuzumab also targets HER-2 receptors but in a different way, preventing cancer cells from dividing. Lapatinib and Neratinib hinder multiple pathways that promote cancer cell growth. Trastuzumab Emtansine combines trastuzumab with a chemotherapy drug, and Pyrotinib blocks HER-2 receptor signaling. These drugs offer targeted therapies for different aspects of HER-2 positive breast cancer.</p></p>
