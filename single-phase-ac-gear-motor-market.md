<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Phase AC Gear-Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous</li><li>Asynchronous</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The single-phase AC gear-motor market can be divided into two types: synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous gear-motors, the rotation of the motor is synchronized with the frequency of the alternating current, resulting in precise speed control. Asynchronous gear-motors, on the other hand, do not have a synchronized rotation with the AC frequency. They rely on electromagnetic induction to operate, providing reliable torque and high starting torque. Both types have their advantages and are commonly used in various applications requiring different speed control and torque requirements.</p></p>
