<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open-Angle Glaucoma Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prostaglandin Analogs (PGAs)</li><li>Combination of PGAs</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open-angle glaucoma is treated using various therapeutic options. One commonly used medication type is Prostaglandin Analogs (PGAs), which work by reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and increasing fluid drainage from the eye. Another approach is the combination of different PGAs to enhance their effectiveness. These combinations can provide better IOP reduction than either drug alone. Additionally, there are other medications available that target different mechanisms to lower IOP, such as beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. These different therapies provide clinicians with a range of options to manage open-angle glaucoma effectively.</p></p>
