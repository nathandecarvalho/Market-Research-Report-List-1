<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wound drainage devices refer to the tools or systems used to collect and remove excessive fluid or debris from a wound site during the healing process. The market for these devices can be divided into two main types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains work based on gravity, allowing fluid to flow out of the wound naturally. Active drains, on the other hand, use negative pressure to actively suction fluid from the wound, enhancing the drainage process. Both types are essential in managing wound exudate effectively for better healing outcomes.</p></p>
