<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Wires & Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing wires and leads are used in emergency situations to provide temporary pacing to the heart. There are two main types of temporary pacing wires: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar pacing wires have one electrode, while bipolar pacing wires have two electrodes. Unipolar wires are less expensive but may have higher risks of complications due to their reliance on the heart as a return electrode. Bipolar wires are considered safer as they have two electrodes closer together, reducing the risk of tissue damage and other complications.</p></p>
