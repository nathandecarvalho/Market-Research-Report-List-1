<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Dilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Sinus Dilation</li><li>No-Balloon Sinus Dilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sinus dilators are used for treating sinusitis and improving nasal airflow. Balloon sinus dilation involves inserting a small balloon into the sinus cavity and inflating it to expand the sinuses, providing relief from congestion and pain. On the other hand, no-balloon sinus dilation techniques involve using specialized instruments to widen the sinus passages without the use of a balloon. Both methods aim to alleviate sinus symptoms and improve breathing, but they differ in their approach to dilating the sinuses.</p></p>
